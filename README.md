Zabbix Network Monitoring Project

## Objective
This project involved setting up a comprehensive network monitoring system using VMWare Workstation Player. The network, assigned the IP range 192.168.244.0/24, included multiple virtual machines running different operating systems, all monitored by a dedicated network monitoring tool.

- To monitor network traffic across the virtual network.
- To track the system uptime of each virtual machine.
- To measure CPU utilization for each guest OS.

## Setup and Configuration
- IP Range: 192.168.244.0/24
- Windows 10 - Guest OS
- Linux Ubuntu - Guest OS
- Zabbix Appliance - Network Monitor

## Tools and Technologies
VMWare Workstation Player: Virtualization software used to create and manage the virtual machines.
Zabbix Appliance: Deployed as the primary network monitoring tool to gather and display data on network traffic, system uptime, and CPU utilization.
